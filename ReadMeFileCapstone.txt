Hello,

My name is John Lee and this is my capstone project for BrainStation's Data Science program.

The focus of my capstone project was to predict the outcome of a shot right after a timeout. 

As an NBA and fantasy sports fan, I knew that my capstone would be related to basketball, as I wanted to combine my passion to my work. 
I realized as I was watching a couple games, timeouts were arbitrarily called or called automatically to save a loose ball without any thought. 
I saw this as an opportunity to use machine learning to optimize the effect of a timeout.

I was interested in the following:
1. How can timeouts be used strategically in the game?
2. What features of the game can coaches focus on when drawing up out of timeout plays?

The dataset for this capstone project was scraped from Basketball Reference, a popular basketball data website. 
The website is a credible source of basketball stats and was scraped by a Kaggle user and uploaded to Kaggle.

There are 2 notebooks for this project, to be read in this order:

1. Capstone Project Part 1 - Feature Engineering the dependent variable
2. Capstone Project Part 2 - Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, EDA, Modeling, Insights and Findings

The required data to run the notebook can be found here:

Please make sure to have the data on the same file path as the notebooks.

The report that summarizes the project can be found attached as well.
